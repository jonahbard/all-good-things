Sometimes, it seems like all news is bad news. This can make people avoidant of news/current events altogether, which is bad for democracy and can increase people seeking out congenial information, which can lead to echo chambers and polarization. Current media landscapes also are driven by incentives to increase click/share rates, which often leads to bad news being more widely shared/read than good news; we want to circumvent these incentives and allow people to learn about inspiring and positive developments in the world.

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Set Up
1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
